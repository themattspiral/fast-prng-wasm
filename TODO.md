## TODO

This library is currently a work-in-progress, hobby project in alpha stage.

As such, the interface is subject to change and shift somewhat, until reaching v1.0.0.

## Roadmap
Feel free to [suggest features and report any issues](https://github.com/themattspiral/fast-prng-wasm/issues) you encounter.

### Features
- PCG jump (change increment value)
- Bounded integer output
- WASM feature detection (SIMD)
- web demo 
- assemblyscript consumer demo
- cache second output when returning single values from SIMD types to force output streams to match between single and array?

### Tech Debt
- type definitions
- source typescript conversion
- CI/CD github actions
- tests
