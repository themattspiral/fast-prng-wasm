## TODO

This library is currently a work-in-progress, hobby project in alpha stage.

As such, the interface is subject to change and shift somewhat, until reaching v1.0.0.

## Roadmap
Feel free to [suggest features and report any issues](https://github.com/themattspiral/fast-prng-wasm/issues) you encounter.

# Remaining MVP for 1.0.0 Release
- RandomGenerator typescript conversion (or provide types)
- speed optimization notes (algo selection, unchecked, O3, @inline, stub, branch minimization with separate functions)
- web demos
- assemblyscript inclusion demo
- update tooling

### Future Features / Demos
- Bounded integer output
- speed tradeoff design comparison tests

### Tech Debt
- CI/CD (github actions)
- test coverage
